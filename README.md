# Neural ODEs for Time-Series Forecasting

This project implements Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to model and forecast time-series data. Neural ODEs can be applied to finance, physics, and electrical engineering data.

## Setup

1. Activate virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run scripts in src/ to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
